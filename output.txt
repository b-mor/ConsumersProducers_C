Segmentation fault (core dumped)

*notice here that matrix 2 is empty so it seg faults from that.
*we would have to inspect the producer threads and the consumer.
*my thought is that the one of the threads is holding up
*and wont produce or consume anything.
*it most likly is the producer thread though.
